<p><center> <b>The International Conference on Cultural Heritage (CH) brings together researchers, policy makers, <br>
    professionals and practitioners to explore some of the more pressing issues concerning cultural heritage today. <br>
	In particular, the main goal of the conference is to focus on interdisciplinary and multi-disciplinary research on <br>
	tangible and intangible Cultural Heritage, the use of cutting edge technologies for the protection, restoration, <br>
	preservation, massive digitalization, documentation and presentation of the CH content. At the same time, the <br>
	event is intended to cover topics of research ready for exploitation, demonstrating the acceptability of new <br>
	sustainable approaches and new technologies by the user community, SMEâ€™s, owners, managers and <br>
	conservators of cultural patrimony. <br> </center> <br>
	
	<center>We are seeking original, innovative and previously unpublished contributions in theoretical or applied Digital Heritage areas.<br>
	All papers will be double-blind peer-reviewed by at minimum 3 referees from the International Scientific Committee. <br>
	Every submission will have at least one technical and one cultural reviewer to ensure a rich diversity of accepted works <br>
	spanning both technology and the humanities. All submissions will be reviewed for originality, significance, clarity, impact, and soundness.<br>
