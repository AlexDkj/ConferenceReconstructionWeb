<br>
The ultimate aim of the 6th EuroMed conference will be to bring together as many stakeholders as possible <br>
from different backgrounds in order to achieve a high level of mutual understanding of the needs, the <br>
requirements and the technical means of meeting them. Therefore, our common goal is to focus on <br>
interdisciplinary and multi-disciplinary research on tangible and intangible Cultural Heritage, the use of cutting<br>
edge technologies for the protection, preservation, conservation, massive digitalisation and <br>
visualization/presentation of the Cultural Heritage content (archeological sites, artifacts, monuments, libraries, <br>
archives, museums, etc). At the same time, the event is intended to cover topics of research ready for <br>
exploitation, demonstrating the acceptability of new sustainable approaches and new technologies by the user <br>
community, SMEâ€™s, owners, managers and conservators of cultural patrimony.<br><br>
