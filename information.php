<p class="inside">Authors of accepted full papers will have to give a 25 minute oral presentation (including 5-10 minutes for <br>
    questions from the audience).<br>
    Please present yourself to the Session Chair well before your session start.<br>
    Authors slides will be presented via a video projector (see details below).<br>

<h3 class="inside" style="font-size: 30px;"> Short/Project Papers </h3><br>
<p class="inside">Authors of accepted SHORT and PROJECT papers will be required to do a short presentation (15 minutes net <br>
    time). Project Paper presentations will have a duration of 15 minutes long. Short Paper presentations will have <br>
	a duration of 10 minutes long. Moreover, there will be an opportunity for informal questions and discussion <br>
	during the dedicated Short Paper posters breaks. Each <b>SHORT paper</b> will be also presented in a <b>poster <br>
	session </b>(during the coffee break following oral presentation). It is therefore a REQUIREMENT for publication <br>
	that you prepare both a short oral presentation and a poster of your <b>short paper</b> for display. The exact lay out of<br>
	the poster is at your discretion but the poster should be of A0 size and preferably laminated (<b><u><a href="EuroMed2016_Cyprus_Poster_presentations.pdf" target="_blank">Guidelines</a></u></b>). If you <br>
	have any queries regarding these final requirements, feel free to contact us.
