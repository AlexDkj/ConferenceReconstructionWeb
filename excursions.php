<p><img src="assets/images/asinou.jpg" width="350" height="150" align="left">The church of Panagia Phorviotissa, or Panagia Asinou (Panagia is called in Greek the Mother of God), named <br>
  after the nearest village that used to exist in the area, is located on the north foothills of one of the mountains <br>
  that dominate Cyprus’s inland center, Troodos mountain, on the east bank of a stream, three kilometers south <br>
  of Nikitari village. According to the dedicatory inscription above its south entrance the church was initially <br>
  erected between 1099 and 1105 CE by the magistrate Nikiphoros<br><br></p>

<p><br>
The participants visiting Asinou will get the chance to be provided a tour which exceeds the typical<br><img src="assets/images/asinou2.jpg" width="350" height="150" align="right">
“touristic” presentation of the tourist guides. Being scientists and prominent experts themselves, they will be<br>
provided with a scientific presentation of the state-of-the-art research activities that have been carried out<br>
by the ITN-DCH Marie Sklodowska-Curie fellows, thus acting as a real-life example of the implementation of<br>
multi-scientific and transdisciplinary approach to monument documentation and valorization of the acquired<br>
knowledge. Image-based modelling, 3D data acquisition techniques, digitizing methods and dissemination of<br>
the acquired knowledge are only some of the topics to be demonstrated based on a single case study: that of<br>
Asinou church.</b><br>
